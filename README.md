# zxDeform
This is a ready to go finite element based deformable object simulator. It supports invertable FEM. Beside the traidtion 4-node tetrahedron. It can support arbitrary solid finite element provided the corresponding shape functions and their derivatives are implemented (currently, 10-node tetrahedron is supported). Collision detection (both DCD and CCD) and collision responce (LCP) are implemented. Both contact and friction response are supported. The lib also implements a augmented lagragian method based contact model, which is more suitable for higher-precision simulation. The purpose of the lib is to provide a ready to use FEM-based deformation simulator for researcher. Some of the code are copied from other opensource library like Vega FEM, Febio, El-topo. The usage of the lib should thus complies with the liscence of these libraries and the credit should be give the corresponding authors.

How to Compile:
QT is used for visualization. Just use Qt to open the zxDeform.pro and compile. All the external libraries are incorporated and there is no need to link any external libraries. Or you just need to include all the files in ./src folder and set up the includepath to the third_party folder.
